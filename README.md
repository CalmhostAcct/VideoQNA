# VideoQNA
VideoQNA is a powerful tool that enables users to effortlessly create engaging, AI-generated Q&A videos—similar in style to those produced by platforms like WHYS.video. It combines the capabilities of ChatGPT (GPT-4o) for generating intelligent and coherent responses, MoviePy for automated video editing and composition, and gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for voice synthesis.

# ✨ Key Features
Automated Q&A Generation: Simply input a question, and GPT-4o generates a well-researched and articulate answer.

Text-to-Speech Narration: Using gTTS, the answer is converted into natural-sounding speech for video narration.

Dynamic Video Creation: MoviePy is used to combine visuals, subtitles, and narration into a complete video, ready to publish.

Customization Ready: Users can modify visuals, audio style, background music, or subtitles to fit their brand or creative vision.

Scalable Content Production: Ideal for daily or high-volume video production with minimal manual effort.
